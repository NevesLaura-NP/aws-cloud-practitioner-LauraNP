#### What is Cloud Computing?
Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. On-demand delivery indicates that AWS has the resources you need, when you need them. 

#### What are the three deployment models for cloud computing, their definitions, and uses?
- Cloud-based Deployment Model, you can migrate existing applications to the cloud, or you can design and build new applications in the cloud. You can build those applications on low-level infrastructure that requires your IT staff to manage them.
  - Run all parts of the application in the cloud.
  - Migrate existing applications to the cloud.
  - Design and build new applications in the cloud.
- On-premises deployment is also known as a private cloud deployment.  In this model, resources are deployed on premises by using virtualization and resource management tools.
  - Deploy resources by using virtualization and resource management tools.
  - Increase resource utilization by using application management and virtualization technologies.
- Hybrid deployment, cloud-based resources are connected to on-premises infrastructure. You might want to use this approach in a number of situations. For example, you have legacy applications that are better maintained on premises, or government regulations require your business to keep certain records on premises.
  - Connect cloud-based resources to on-premises infrastructure.
  - Integrate cloud-based resources with legacy IT applications.
